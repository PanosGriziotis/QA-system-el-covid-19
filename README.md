# Description

This repository is part of a project aimed at developing a Greek-language Question-Answering (QA) subsystem for integration with a closed-domain virtual assistant focused on COVID-19, named [Theano](https://aclanthology.org/2021.nlp4posimpact-1.5/).

The QA system can operate as a standalone application or be accessed via an API for integration into other applications.

The `docker-compose` file enables you to start the main backend services:

- An [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch) container, which serves as the Document Store.
- A Question-Asnwering (QA) REST API container based on the [Haystack](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/v1.25/docs/intro) logic. This API consists of an indexing pipeline for storing text documents in the Document Store and a query pipeline for returning answers to given queries.

## Architecture Overview
![alt text](https://github.com/PanosGriziotis/QA-subsystem-thesis/blob/main/qa_system_architecture_v3.png?raw=true)

There are two types of query pipelines available for inferring answers to queries, based on the following approaches:

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) 

- **Description:** This query pipeline utilizes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method. The answer is a free text generated from retrieved documents. The Generative Reader component is based on the monolingual instruction-following LLM [Meltemi-7B-Instruct-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/ilsp/Meltemi-7B-Instruct-v1.5).

### Extractive Question Answering

- **Description:** This query pipeline utilizes an Extractive QA method. The answer is extracted as a span from a single retrieved document. The Extractive Reader component is a fine-tuned [multilingual DeBERTaV3](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/mdeberta-v3-base) model on SQuAD V2 and the [COVID-QA-el_small](https://huggingface.co/datasets/panosgriz/COVID-QA-el-small) dataset.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure that:

- **Python** version 3.8 or higher is installed on your system.
- **Docker** is installed on your system.

To run the QA system models for inference, you will need:

- A **GPU** with at least 10GB of available memory.
- **CUDA** version 11.8 or higher.

## Set up steps

1. **Clone this repository.**

2. **Run the services**

    Spin up the multi-container application (Elasticsearch + Haystack REST API) using Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4. **Verify that the haystack service is ready:**

    Open a new terminal and run:

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8001/ready
    ```

    You should get `true` as a response.

    Note: The haystack service requires some time to download and load the models after it starts.


## Indexing documents in the Document Store

To populate the backend with data about COVID-19 collected from trusted sources (Wikipedia, ECDC, WHO, NPHO, covid19.gov.gr), run the following:

```bash
python3 external_data/ingest_data_to_doc_store.py
```

You can index your own text data using the file-upload endpoint. Text data are extracted from the uploaded files, converted into document objects, and preprocessed before being stored in the Document Store

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
'http://localhost:8001/file-upload?keep_files=false' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
-F 'files=@YOUR-TEXT-FILE'
```

Note: Acceptable file formats are .txt, .json, .jsonl, .pdf, .docx.


## Start Asking the QA System

### Streamlit Web UI

This is a simple UI app built with Streamlit, providing an interactive user interface for querying the backend server.

### Features

- **Pipeline Selection**: Choose between RAG and Extractive QA query pipelines.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Enter JSON parameters to control the query pipeline components.
- **Interactive Query Input**: Type your question and get answers from the backend server.

### Setup steps

1. **Create a virtual environment:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
2. **Activate the virtual environment:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependecies:**

```bash
pip install -r ui/requirements.txt
```

4. **Ensure Backend services are running:**

- The Haystack service should be running at `http://localhost:8001`
- Elasticsearch should be running at `http://localhost:9200`
- Ensure that documents are indexed in the Document Store. You can inspect indices using this command:

```bash
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v"
```

5. **Launch the Web UI:**


```bash
streamlit run ui/web_app.py
```

Access the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Using the QA System's REST API

To query the QA system directly via the REST API, send a POST request. This request will return a complete JSON response, including the answer to your query, retrieved documents, confidence scores, and additional details. Depending on the desired method for inferring the answer to the given query, you can use the corresponding endpoint: `rag-query` employs a RAG query pipeline, while `extractive-query` utilizes the extractive QA query pipeline.

Replace the query and parameters as needed. The following example is configured to use the RAG pipeline at `http://localhost:8001/rag-query`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/rag-query \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
            "query": "Πώς μεταδίδεται ο covid-19;", 
            "params": {
                "BM25Retriever": {"top_k": 10},
                "DenseRetriever": {"top_k": 10},
                "Reranker": {"top_k": 6}, 
                "GenerativeReader": {"max_new_tokens": 150}
            }
        }'
```
